# Ableton Unity Bridge
Tools to connect Ableton and Unity

Currently, this project supports Link with some Unity side callback scaffolding.

# Rationale
Music visualization tools suck, game developers can do better, but Ableton integration is barely existent. The hope is this bridge can reduce the effort musicians and developers need to work together.

Intended for installations or performances. Requires that Ableton be installed and open (if it's possible to rip out the Ableton core and include it in a build that'd be cool but I doubt it)

# Still to do:
- improve link exposure link with fewer use case assumptions
- MIDI Interoperability
- PCM Interoperability 
- Unity Linked Timeline

Im unsure about the feasibility of some of this as Ableton seems quite closed. I was hoping to send PCM/midi/automation from unity to Ableton and back (hijack the realtime DSP library) This may be possible using a virtual device/vst or something but I'm not sure at this point.

#### This project is very early in development but if you like the idea and want to contribute or chat about it let me know!
